# NM-Project
ðŸ“˜ Project 1: Speech-to-Text with Noise Robustness
This project aims to build a speech recognition system that performs well even in noisy environments using pre-trained models and noise-augmented data.

âœ… Features
Uses wav2vec2.0 pretrained model (from Hugging Face Transformers)

Incorporates noise-robust preprocessing (e.g., Voice Activity Detection)

Supports real-time and batch transcription

Computes Word Error Rate (WER) and accuracy

ðŸ“¥ Inputs
Clean and noisy .wav audio samples

Ground truth transcripts (for evaluation)

ðŸ“¤ Outputs
Transcribed text

WER, accuracy, confusion matrix

ðŸ“˜ Project 2: Feature Extraction and Language Modeling Integration
This unit focuses on extracting speech features and building an n-gram language model to enhance transcription accuracy.

âœ… Features
MFCC feature extraction using librosa

Trains n-gram (unigram, bigram, trigram) language models

Computes n-gram frequency statistics

Integrates language model with decoder

ðŸ“¥ Inputs
Raw text corpus for LM

Audio data for feature extraction

ðŸ“¤ Outputs
Trained language model

Top n-grams

Visualizations (bar charts, word clouds)

ðŸ“˜ Project 5: EDA, Visualization, and Power BI Integration
Performs in-depth analysis and visualization of text/audio features and ASR performance.

âœ… Features
EDA on audio durations, word frequency, noise patterns

Word cloud, bar charts for top n-grams

Confusion matrix and WER plots

Exports performance data for Power BI

ðŸ“¥ Inputs
Transcription logs

Raw text and audio feature files

ðŸ“¤ Outputs
Visual insights (matplotlib/Power BI-ready CSVs)

Power BI dashboard .pbix file (optional)
